# ⚙️ Agent Bus RS
**The Intelligence Engine of the Neenyo Ecosystem.**

## Purpose
Rust-native implementation of the **RDK-3 Witness Quorum**. This bus manages the communication between environmental sensors and the state-lock.

## The Triple-Observer Model
The system requires a Quorum of Observations to collapse the qubit state:
* **Visual Agent:** Scans for Qube geometry.
* **Sonar Agent:** Validates spatial network echos.
* **Acoustic Agent:** Matches frequency resonance (Experiential Soundscapes).
